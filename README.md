**Overview**

In the vast and varied landscape of human culture, music holds a special place. It's more than just a form of entertainment; it's a powerful medium that can uplift spirits, mitigate pain and anxiety, and offer a channel for emotional expression. Numerous studies support the idea that music can have profound effects on both our physical and mental health. In light of this, there has been a growing interest in analyzing the elements that contribute to a song's popularity. By dissecting song samples and examining their components, researchers aim to uncover patterns and factors that influence a track's success. The primary goal of this endeavor is to develop predictive models that can accurately forecast song popularity.

**Objectives**

Dataset Analysis: Begin with a thorough examination of the dataset to understand its structure and content. Identify any inconsistencies or missing data and perform necessary clean-up tasks to prepare the data for analysis.
Model Development: Employ regression analysis to create models capable of predicting the popularity of songs. This involves selecting appropriate variables, testing different regression techniques, and refining models to improve their predictive accuracy.
Model Evaluation and Comparison: Assess the performance of the developed models using standard metrics such as R-squared (R2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and others. Compare these models based on their scores to determine which provides the most reliable predictions of song popularity.
Through these steps, we aim to deepen our understanding of what makes a song resonate with listeners and achieve widespread popularity.
