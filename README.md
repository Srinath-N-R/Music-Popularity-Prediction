**Objectives**

**Dataset Analysis:** Review and clean the dataset to ensure it is ready for analysis. This includes identifying and addressing any missing or inconsistent data.


**Model Development:** Develop regression models to predict song popularity. This process involves selecting relevant features, experimenting with various regression techniques, and refining the models to enhance prediction accuracy.


**Model Evaluation and Comparison:** Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics like R-squared (R2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Compare the models to determine which performs best in predicting song popularity.
The aim is to understand and quantify the factors that contribute to a song's success.
